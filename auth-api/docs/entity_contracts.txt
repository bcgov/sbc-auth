Entity Resource

Note: This resource is used to shadow a LEAR Entity in the sbc-auth application.  We only store entity data that is required for affiliating entities to organizations.

/entities
	GET
	Description: Returns a list of entities that the current user is affiliated with (via their Org membership)
	Permissions: Any

	PUT
	Description: Used to update entity information (e.g. business contact info)

	POST (Internal Only)
	Description: Create a new Entity from the request body
	Note: The implementation of this endpoint would likely GET an entity from LEAR and store the relevant data in AUTH
	Permissions: Must be an admin of an org and have provided a valid passcode for that entity

/entities/{entity_id}
	GET (Internal Only)
	Description: Get an Entity specified by the entity_id
	Permissions: Must be an admin of an org that has been affiliated with the given entity
