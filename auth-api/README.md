# AUTH API

BC Registries authentication and authorization services.


## Development Environment

Follow the instructions of the [Development Readme](https://github.com/bcgov/entity/blob/master/docs/development.md)
to setup your local development environment.

## Technology Stack Used
* Python, Flask
* Postgres -  SQLAlchemy, psycopg2-binary & alembic

### setup
Fork the repo and submitted a PR with accompanning tests.

Set to use the local repo for the virtual environment
```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
Install the dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```

Configure the .env

### manage the DB
```bash
poetry shell
```

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

```bash
flask db migrate
```

## Running the Auth Database on localhost

To prepare your local database:
1. In the [root project folder](../docker/docker-compose.yml): `docker-compose up -d`
2. In your environment: `poetry run flask db upgrade` or `flask db upgrade`


Note:

**[Windows Users]**
If using WSL, may need to change the host from localhost -> <computer-name>.local
EX. in config.py and .env.

**[Mac Users]**
: You might get an error regarding the SSL certificate verification failed.
follow the steps to resolve that issue:
1. Open the terminal window, and run **`python3 -v`** command to check the version of python.
2. run the following command:
```
pip install certifi /Applications/Python\ <version of your python>/Install\ Certificates.command
```

eg: if your python version is 3.7,
then, run

```
pip install certifi /Applications/Python\ 3.7/Install\ Certificates.command
```

## Running AUTH-API

1. Start the flask server with `(poetry run flask run)`
2. View the [OpenAPI Docs](http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1).

## Running Liniting

1. Run `make flake8` or `flake8 src/auth_api tests`.
2. Run `make pylint` or `pylint --rcfile=setup.cfg --disable=C0301,W0511 src/auth_api test`

## Running Unit Tests

1. Tests are run from the Status bar at the bottom of the workbench in VS Code or `pytest` command.
2. Next run `make coverage` to generate the coverage report, which appears in the *htmlcov* directory.

## Running Integration (postman) Tests

1. Start your local application(s).
2. Open postman applicaiton.
3. Import the [Integration tests environment configrations](./tests/postman/auth-api.postman_environment.json) and fill the values to match your applicaiton.
4. Import the [integration tests collection](./tests/postman/auth-api.postman_collection.json).
5. Run the collection.
