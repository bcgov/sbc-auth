# BC Registiries authentication and authorization services

BC Registries and Online Services is beginning a phased, multi-year modernization initiative to replace and improve the applications used for BC Online, the Corporate, Personal Property and Manufactured Homes Registries. Our vision is to develop a better service experience and make it easier for citizens and businesses to complete transactions and filings with the province of BC and across other jurisdictions, manage accounts and pay for services.

The sbc-auth repo aims to create an common authentication module for BC registries which can be utilised by different services.
