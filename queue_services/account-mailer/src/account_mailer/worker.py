"""The unique worker functionality for this service is contained here.

The entry-point is the **cb_subscription_handler**

The design and flow leverage a few constraints that are placed upon it
by NATS Streaming and using AWAIT on the default loop.
- NATS streaming queues require one message to be processed at a time.
- AWAIT on the default loop effectively runs synchronously

If these constraints change, the use of Flask-SQLAlchemy would need to change.
Flask-SQLAlchemy currently allows the base model to be changed, or reworking
the model to a standalone SQLAlchemy usage with an async engine would need
to be pursued.
