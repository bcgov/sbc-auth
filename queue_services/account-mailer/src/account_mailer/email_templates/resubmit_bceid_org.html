# Your Account Creation Request is On hold.

Thank you for your interest with BC Registries and Online Services.  Our office was attempting to approve your application sent on {{ applicationDate }} but, had to place your account creation request on hold for the following reason(s):

{%for i in range(0, remarks|length)%}
*  **{{'%02d' % (i+1)}}. {{remarks[i]}}**
{%endfor%}

By clicking on the button below, you will be directed to log in. Log in using your BCeID. You will require a one time passcode from your 2 factor authenticator. After log in you will be navigated to the account creation process. You will only be able to edit step 3: "Upload Affidavit" and step 4: ”User Profile”. After resolving the issue in step 3 and 4, press "submit" on step 5.

If you experience any errors, please take screen prints and contact our helpdesk at bconline@gov.bc.ca for assistance. Once you have successfully updated your information, our office will receive a new notification and we will attempt to verify your account information.
