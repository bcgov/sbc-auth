to setup your local development environment.

## Development Setup

1. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/bcgov/entity/blob/master/docs/setup-forking-workflow.md) to checkout the project from GitHub.
2. Open the notebook-report directory in VS Code to treat it as a project (or WSL projec). To prevent version clashes, set up a virtual environment to install the Python packages used by this project.
3. Run `make setup` to set up the virtual environment and install libraries.

## Running Notebook Report

1. Run `. venv/bin/activate` to change to `venv` environment.
2. Run notebook with `(python notebookreport.py)`

   ```sh
   oc project 6e0e49-tools
   ```

   oc process -f openshift/templates/bc.yaml \
	  -p GIT_REPO_URL=https://github.com/bcgov/sbc-auth.git \
	  -p GIT_REF=development
	  -o yaml \
   | oc apply -f - -n 6e0e49-tools     
   ```

4. Checking log for building process at Console => Administrator => Builds => Builds => click image 'notebook-report' => logs

     | oc apply -f - -n 6e0e49-dev
