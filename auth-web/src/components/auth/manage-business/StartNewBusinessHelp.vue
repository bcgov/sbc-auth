              Decide which business structure is the most appropriate for you. A few options are: a sole
              proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. Each structure has different legal and financial
              implications.

            <li>
              To start a named business in B.C., change the business name of an existing company, or
              merge two or more companies using a new name, click the
              <strong>"Get Started with a B.C. Based Business"</strong> button on this
              screen and follow the instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Before registering or incorporating a named business, you will need to first submit a Name Request.
              You will be asked to create a unique name for your business and submit your name(s) for review by BC
              Registries staff.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once you submit your Name Request you can return to this screen and your Name Request (NR) will
              automatically appear in your table.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you do not see your Name Request in your table (e.g. if you submitted your Name Request without
              being logged into your BC Registries account), you can add your Name Request manually by looking up
              your business name or your NR number.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can track the approval status of your Name Request from your table on this screen by clicking the
              <strong>"Open Name Request"</strong> button next to your Name Request.
